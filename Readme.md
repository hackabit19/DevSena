# ACCIDetect ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)
###AI based accident detection system

We are providing a system to integrate with the CCTV cameras of roads and provide a quick response to accident victim<br/><br/>
Map:
Accident happens + facts x number of death due to road accident happens y% die due to late response by the tespective authority
People fear+ many places like highway there are no people to make a complain neither police
There are CCTV installed but very few people are assigned to very large recordings
We are providing a system to integrate with the CCTV cameras of roads and provide a quick response to accident victim
Computer Vision with deep learing is used on a dataset of about 1000 road accidents.
We were suggested to include more features to it such as using the same for robbery detection,fire etc

## WorkFlow
* The data set is resized,added in to a vector,normalised between values of 0 and 1,convoluted pooled ,flattened ,to extract the important featured and reduce rhe vector size of the input.
* We have used a normal CNN and aiming to use better algorithm such as resNet to improve the accuracy
* The cleaned data is fed in to a neural network to classify if an accident has happened or not
